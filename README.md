# Swift Glue Code - 360iDev

Here's the full keynote slides and sample project for Swift Glue Code, presented at 360iDev 2016. This project and slide set covers:

* How to prepare your Objective-C code for migration
* A good wrapping strategy in Swift
* Some information on Swift calling conventions

There's a couple of things mentioned in the talk that are missing from the sample (direct call to Swift) but hopefully they can be added soon!
