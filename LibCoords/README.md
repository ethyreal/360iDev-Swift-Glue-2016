## Swift glue code demo project

This project consists of a Swift library which represents a fanciful world in which there are ridculous coordinate systems, and a command-line interface written in Objective-C which consumes it. There are probably some branches or tags that give you useful information about certain types of Swift-to-ObjC bridging work.
