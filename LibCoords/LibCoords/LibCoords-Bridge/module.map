// This is the "module" that is used to import the Objective-C side of the bridge that is
// contained within the Swift framework.
//
// There is only one issue! The first time you build this library (or after a DerivedData clean), and then try and compile
// in Objective-C, you will get an error regarding '@import LibCoordsBridge' - the compiler believes
// this is a real module. So you will need to *manually remove* this line after each compile of the library.
// Make extra sure you do this if you're shipping a library with bridge code!

module LibCoordsBridge [system] {
    header "Location.h"
